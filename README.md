# Sports-Betting-Chrome-Extension

(1) Tool that integrates directly with major books like Kalshi, FanDuel, and Draftkings. It allows you to analyze player props, while showing you where the best odds are currently live and links your sports books accounts to track your ROI from several sports betting apps - providing insight into how much money and time your spending and means to stop sports betting if it's a problem.  


Requirements: 
Extensions will need to handle both WebSockets (for Kalshi's rapid updates) and REST APIs or DOM Scraping (for FanDuel).
Implementation Checklist

Check Selectors: Verify that .team-name-class is the actual class FanDuel is currently using (these change frequently).

Debouncing: If the page is very active, the observer might fire too often. You can "debounce" the performMatch function to limit it to running once every 500ms.

Permissions: Ensure your manifest.json has host_permissions for both Kalshi and FanDuel.

   Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. **Enable Developer Mode:**
   Toggle the **"Developer mode"** switch in the top-right corner.

## 🛠 Project Structure
* `manifest.json`: Extension configuration and permissions.
* `background.js`: Handles Kalshi WebSocket connections and Auth.
* `content.js`: Scrapes FanDuel DOM and injects the overlay UI.
* `popup/`: The UI for manual market linking and API key entry.
* `assets/`: Icons and CSS stylesheets.

## 🔒 Security Note
This extension uses `chrome.storage.session` to store Kalshi tokens. This ensures your session data is wiped every time the browser is closed. Never commit your `config.js` or API keys to a public repository.
